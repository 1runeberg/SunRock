# SUN ROCK (early release alpha)
**UE4 LIVELINK &amp; INPUT SYSTEM PLUGIN FOR STEAMVR KNUCKLES**

Includes a Livelink Plugin for SteamVR's new Knuckles Streaming Hand Skeletal Data System and a hook to the new Action Binding System to UE4's native Event System.

This demo project only works with UE4.21, SteamVR EV2 & EV3 Knuckles Hardware **AND** Steam **MUST** be running.

**NOTE 1: If you are using a custom 4.21 Build (i.e. from Source rather than from the Launcher), use the following instructions to ensure the Binary plugins here work for your Source Built Engine:**

1. Go to 'Plugins > KnucklesLiveLink > Binaries > Win64' 
2. Edit the 'UE4Editor.modules' file. 
3. Change the BuildID to match your UE4 editor BuildID and it'll load (find this by looking in 'Engine > Binaries > Win64 > UE4Editor.modules')

**NOTE 2: To reset Action Manifest for UE4Editor to defaults:**

1. Go to "Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\steamvr.settings"
2. In there, will have a section called "system.generated.ue4editor.exe"
3. Delete this section to restore defaultsÂ
